Phase 2 Document: Data Wrangling and Analysis for Dynamic Pricing in E-commerce

Introduction
Phase 2 of our project is dedicated to data wrangling and analysis, essential steps in preparing the raw dataset for implementing a dynamic pricing system for an e-commerce platform. This phase involves employing various data manipulation techniques using Python to clean, transform, and explore the dataset. The objective is to ensure data quality and derive meaningful insights to optimize pricing strategies.

Objectives:

Cleanse the dataset by addressing inconsistencies, errors, and missing values to ensure data integrity.
Explore the dataset's characteristics through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand price distributions, demand patterns, and competitor behavior.
Engineer relevant features to enhance model performance for dynamic pricing decisions.
Document the data wrangling process comprehensively to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
Dataset Description
The dataset comprises historical transactional data from an e-commerce platform, including product information, pricing details, customer demographics, and sales data. Each record represents a transaction or interaction between customers and products, forming the foundation for implementing dynamic pricing strategies.

Data Wrangling Techniques

Data Description
Head: Display the first few rows of the dataset for initial inspection.
Tail: Examine the last few rows of the dataset to ensure completeness.
Info: Obtain information about the dataset structure, data types, and memory usage.
Describe: Generate descriptive statistics for numerical features to understand their distributions and central tendencies.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data description
print(data.head())
print(data.tail())
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
Null Data Handling
Null Data Identification: Identify missing values in the dataset.
Null Data Imputation: Fill missing values with appropriate strategies.
Null Data Removal: Eliminate rows or columns with excessive missing values.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for null data handling
print(data.isnull().sum())
data = data.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
Data Validation
Data Integrity Check: Verify data consistency and integrity to eliminate errors.
Data Consistency Verification: Ensure data consistency across different columns or datasets.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data validation
# Check for unique values in a column
print(data['column_name'].unique())
Data Reshaping
Reshaping Rows and Columns: Transform the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.
Transposing Data: Convert rows into columns and vice versa as needed.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data reshaping
# Transpose the dataset
transposed_data = data.T
Data Merging
Combining Datasets: Merge multiple datasets or data sources to enrich the information available for analysis.
Joining Data: Join datasets based on common columns or keys.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data merging
merged_data = pd.merge(data1, data2, on='common_column')
Data Aggregation
Grouping Data: Group dataset rows based on specific criteria.
Aggregating Data: Compute summary statistics for grouped data.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for data aggregation
grouped_data = data.groupby('category_column')
aggregated_data = grouped_data.agg({'numerical_column': 'mean'})
Data Analysis Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Analyze price distributions and other individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between pricing and customer behavior.
Multivariate Analysis: Explore interactions among multiple variables to uncover pricing trends and patterns.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for exploratory data analysis
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Univariate analysis - Histogram of prices
sns.histplot(data['price'], bins=20)
plt.show()

# Bivariate analysis - Scatter plot of price vs. demand
sns.scatterplot(data['price'], data['demand'])
plt.show()

# Multivariate analysis - Pair plot of selected features
sns.pairplot(data[['price', 'demand', 'competitor_price']])
plt.show()
Feature Engineering
Customer Segmentation: Create customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
Temporal Analysis: Incorporate time-related features to capture temporal pricing trends.
Competitor Analysis: Engineer features related to competitor pricing and market dynamics.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for feature engineering
# Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior
data['customer_segment'] = pd.cut(data['purchase_frequency'], bins=3, labels=['low', 'medium', 'high'])

# Temporal analysis - Extract month and day of week from timestamp
data['month'] = data['timestamp'].dt.month
data['day_of_week'] = data['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek

# Competitor analysis - Compute price difference with competitors
data['price_difference'] = data['price'] - data['competitor_price']
Assumed Scenario

Scenario: The project aims to implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize product prices based on demand and market conditions.
Objective: Enhance revenue and competitiveness by adjusting prices dynamically in response to customer behavior and competitor pricing.
Target Audience: E-commerce platform users seeking competitive pricing and value.
Conclusion
Phase 2 focuses on data preparation and analysis to lay the groundwork for implementing a dynamic pricing system in an e-commerce setting. By leveraging Python-based data manipulation techniques and advanced analytics, we aim to extract actionable insights for optimizing pricing strategies and improving business outcomes. This phase sets the stage for developing and deploying dynamic pricing algorithms in the subsequent phases of the project
